# Contrarian Edge

**A long-only contrarian market timing system that identifies fear-driven entry opportunities using VIX/VXV ratio analysis and technical indicator confirmation.**

## Overview

Contrarian Edge generates actionable BUY or WAIT signals by detecting periods of excessive market fear (elevated VIX/VXV ratio) and confirming them with technical indicators. The system exclusively focuses on identifying long entry opportunities for **S&P 500 exposure**â€”no short or hedge recommendations.

**Core Philosophy:** _"Buy when fear peaks, wait when complacency reigns."_

**What to Buy:** When you receive a BUY or STRONG BUY signal, consider purchasing S&P 500 ETFs such as SPY, VOO, IVV, or similar S&P 500 tracking funds.

**Holding Strategy:** Hold positions for 10-20 days or until the VIX/VIX3M ratio returns near 1.0 (indicating fear has normalized). Monitor the ratio daily and consider taking profits when it drops below 0.95 (complacency zone).

1. **VIX/VXV Ratio â‰¥1.05** (40% weight): Core contrarian fear gauge
2. **RSI <40** (25% weight): Oversold conditions favor long entries
3. **MACD Bullish** (20% weight): Momentum confirmation for timing
4. **Above 200-MA** (15% weight): Bull market environment validation

### Example Trade Scenario

**Day 1:** STRONG BUY signal (ratio 1.12) â†’ Buy $10,000 of SPY at $450  
**Day 5:** Ratio drops to 1.05 â†’ Hold (still in fear zone)
