# Contrarian Edge

**A long-only contrarian market timing system that identifies fear-driven entry opportunities using VIX/VXV ratio analysis and technical indicator confirmation.**

## Overview

Contrarian Edge generates actionable BUY or WAIT signals by detecting periods of excessive market fear (elevated VIX/VXV ratio) and confirming them with technical indicators. The system exclusively focuses on identifying long entry opportunitiesâ€”no short or hedge recommendations.

**Core Philosophy:** _"Buy when fear peaks, wait when complacency reigns."_

## Key Features

- Live VIX, VIX3M, and S&P 500 monitoring with percentage/absolute change tracking
- 60-day VIX/VIX3M ratio trend visualization
- Visual progress bar showing current fear levels relative to historical ranges

### Technical Indicators

- **RSI (14-Day)**: Momentum analysis identifying oversold/overbought conditions
- **MACD**: Trend momentum with bullish/bearish crossover detection
- **200-Day MA**: Long-term trend validation and market regime identification
